/**
 * A context-element is a UI element that interacts with a {@link PdfViewer}.
 * <p>
 * When implementing a <code>ContextElement</code>, you should register it in the {@link PdfViewer}
 * via {@link PdfViewer#registerContextElement(ContextElement)} as soon
 * as you know the <code>PdfViewer</code> (usually in the constructor of your implementation).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additionally, you <b>must</b> declare a <code>public static final</code> constant named
 * <code>CONTEXT_ELEMENT_TYPE</code> (and return it in your implementation of {@link #getContextElementType()}),
 * if you don't subclass another <code>ContextElement</code> (that already
 * defines this constant). However, if you subclass one and your new implementation is doing something completely
 * different, you are encouraged to redeclare this <code>CONTEXT_ELEMENT_TYPE</code> (with your new class)
 * in order to indicate that it has semantically nothing in common with the superclass.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can obtain a certain <code>ContextElement</code> for a PdfViewer by
 * {@link PdfViewer#getContextElement(ContextElementType, String)} or all of one type by
 * {@link PdfViewer#getContextElements(ContextElementType)}.
 * </p>
